This repo will hold channel setting files for both the Tidradio TD-H8 & TD-H3 Ham Radio

This radio seems to operate 3 seperate bands, Ham Band, GMRS Band and Frequency Unlocked

I will try put a tag after each channel setting file either (Ham), (GMRS) or (Frequency Unlocked)

Has ive unlocked my TD-H8 receiver frequencies by pressing the 'PTT' and '#' key whilst powering on the device. Then Hit 'Menu' to select 'Yes'. The majority of my channel settings will be for the frequency unlocked version going foward.
